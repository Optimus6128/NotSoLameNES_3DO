LameNES for the 3DO.

It is very slow but it is working.

Credits to Saffron for making it to work. (without a debugger !)

To run, you must put a NES rom file in the CD folder and pack everything with OperaFS.

Here are the controls :

Dpad            =  NES Dpad
C               =  Select
Pause           =  Start
A               =  A
B               =  B
